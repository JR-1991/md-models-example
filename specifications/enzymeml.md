# EnzymeML

EnzymeML is an data exchange format that supports the comprehensive documentation of enzymatic data by describing reaction conditions, time courses of substrate and product concentrations, the kinetic model, and the estimated kinetic constants. EnzymeML is based on the Systems Biology Markup Language, which was extended by implementing the STRENDA Guidelines. An EnzymeML document serves as a container to transfer data between experimental platforms, modeling tools, and databases. EnzymeML supports the scientific community by introducing a standardized data exchange format to make enzymatic data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable according to the FAIR data principles.
